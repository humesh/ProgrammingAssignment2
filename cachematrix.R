## The following two functions deal with Matrix manipulation in R,
## especially in the context of caching matrices.

## This function takes a matrix and returns its inverse in the cache

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The follwoing function computes the inverse of the special matrix 
## returned by the makecacheMatrix function above. If the inverse
## has already been calculated(and the matrix has not changed) then the 
## cacheSolve retrieves the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
